GAMBIT
======
A simple GameBoy emulator
-------------------------

The motivation behind the creation of Gambit is purely academic: to explore emulation and various aspects of the hardware-software interface in a practical setting. Emulation of the Nintendo GameBoy has been accomplished by many people before, but this makes it a great learning exercise: GB emulation is relatively well-documented (as far as proprietary hardware goes), there is a fairly substantial amount of open-source code to use as reference, and success is rewarded by clear visual evidence and the ability to play some fun classic games.
